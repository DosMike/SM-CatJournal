# Cat Journal

### Aka Custom Journal

This is a custom reimplementation of the cat journal for community servers.

It supports MySQL and SQLite storage and is fully customizable.

The default config and plugin code is written with it being a Cat Journal in mind, but you just need to go into the config and change stuff.

This plugin comes without assets, get those yourself.

Config goes into tf/cfg/sourcemod/catjournal.cfg

There's also some values that I dont recommend touching at the top of the plugin source, like pickup delays, but I'm not your mom so go wild if you can't help yourself
